description: Overview of RIP's supply and distribution of tokens.
---

# RIP

We have a supply of 10,000,000 RIP with the following allocation:

* 10% to founders
* 10% to partners and community initiatives 
* 10% to Community Treasury
* 10% to [the Giving Block](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)
* 10% to ITO
* 50% to the community 

## Founders

We have set aside these tokens for the founders. These tokens will be locked and released in [TrustSwap Smart Locks](https://team.finance/).

* 25% after Year 1 \(250,000 RIP\)
* 25% after Year 2 \(250,000 RIP\)
* 25% after Year 3 \(250,000 RIP\)
* 25% after Year 4 \(250,000 RIP\)

Currently there are three founders. 

## Partners and community initiatives

We would like to create partnerships with the following companies:

* [Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/)
* [Copper](https://copper.co/)
* [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/)
* [Avascan](https://avascan.info/)
* [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/)

The funds will be used to achieve these partnership deals.

## Community Treasury

The funds held in the community treasury will be controlled by a multisig and will be used to hire:

* Developers
* Designers
* Community managers
* Other positions as demand arises

### Current Distribution plans

* 116,000 RIP to the eligible Airdrop recipients \(1,000 RIP each\)
* 20,000 for early communities who complete a survey on the prototype \(1,000 RIP each\)

### Bounties

We will be offering bounties for delivering key pieces of functionality.

The first bounties are:

* Implement the Prototype in React \(100,000 RIP\)
* Implement the Will Smart Contract \(100,000 RIP\)
* Community manager \(variable based on Milestones such as Discord, Twitter membership\)

## The Giving Block

A key objective of this project is to create something that leaves the world a better place than the one we've found it in. In this spirit, 10% of the total supply of RIP will be donated to [the Giving Block.](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)

We are also in discussions with them on how we can then enable functionality in Crypt which will allow users to leave a percentage of their Crypto holdings to charities registered through the Giving Block.

## ITO

We will distribute the initial coins via an Initial Token Offering. Currently no DEX on Avalanche supports this functionality. We see this as key to the success of our launch and will engage some funds from the Community fund \(See bounties for more information\) to fund the Pangolin community developers to build this functionality.

We will then release 1,000,000 RIP into the ITO as follows:

* 500,000 PreSale
* 500,000 Liquidity

Please see this [post](https://hariseldon2.medium.com/pangolin-ito-initial-token-offering-725d3d22a80) for more information on the proposed ITO we'll be building.

## Community 

We have set aside these tokens for the community. These tokens will be locked and released in [TrustSwap Smart Locks](https://team.finance/).

* 25% after Year 1 \(1,250,000 RIP\)
* 25% after Year 2 \(1,250,000 RIP\)
* 25% after Year 3 \(1,250,000 RIP\)
* 25% after Year 4 \(1,250,000 RIP\)

## Token demand

We will create demand via the following mechanisms:

* When someone creates a will, we lock up 1000 RIP until the death occurs. This removes those tokens, thereby increasing scarcity. This 1000 RIP is based on a $0.10 USD valuation. This rate can be changed based upon the price point of RIP to ensure it can adjust to the market.
* When someone makes a change, they get charged 10 RIP
* When a Will is distributed, the RIP comes back into circulation
* We will also offer Staking rewards similar to CREAM with the following rewards:
  * 38% APY
  * 65% APY
  * 109% APY
  * 134% APY
* Used in Governance voting
