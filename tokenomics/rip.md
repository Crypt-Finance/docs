description: Overview of RIP's supply and distribution of tokens.
---

# RIP

We have a supply of 10,000,000 RIP with the following allocation:

* 10% to founders
* 10% to partners and community initiatives 
* 10% to Community Treasury
* 10% to [the Giving Block](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)
* 10% to IFO
* 50% to the community \(500,000 as an Airdrop\)

## Founders

We have set aside these tokens for the founders. These tokens will be locked and released:

* 25% after Year 1
* 25% after Year 2
* 25% after Year 3
* 25% after Year 4

Currently there are three founders. 

## Partners and community initiatives

We would like to create partnerships with the following companies:

* [Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/)
* [Copper](https://copper.co/)
* [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/)
* [Avascan](https://avascan.info/)
* [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/)

## Community Treasury

The funds held in the community treasury will be controlled by a multisig and will be used to hire:

* Developers
* Designers
* Community managers
* Other positions as demand arises

## The Giving Block

A key objective of this project is to create something that leaves the world a better place than the one we've found it in. In this spirit, 10% of the total supply of RIP will be donated to [the Giving Block.](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)

We are also in discussions with them on how we can then enable functinality in Crypt which will allow users to leave a percentage of their Crypto holdings to charities registered through the Giving Block.

## ITO

We will distribute the initial coins via an Initial Token Offering. Currently no DEX on Avalanche supports this functionality. We see this as key to the success of our launch and will engage some funds from the Partners fund \(250,000 RIP\) to fund the Pangolin community developers to build this functionality.

We will then release 1,000,000 RIP into the IFO as follows:

* 500,000 PreSale
* 500,000 Liquidity

## Token demand

We will create demand via the following mechanisms:

* When someone creates a will, we lock up 1000 RIP until the death occurs. This removes those tokens, thereby increasing scarcity. This 1000 RIP is based on a $0.10 USD valuation. This rate can be changed based upon the price point of RIP to ensure it can adjust to the market.
* When someone makes a change, they get charged 10 RIP
* When a Will is distributed, the RIP comes back into circulation
* We will also offer Staking rewards similar to CREAM with the following rewards:
  * 38% APY
  * 65% APY
  * 109% APY
  * 134% APY
* Used in Governance voting
