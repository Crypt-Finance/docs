# RIP

We have a supply of 10,000,000 RIP with the following allocation:

* 15% to founders
* 10% to partners and community initiatives 
* 10% to Community Treasury
* 10% to IFO
* 55% to the community \(500,000 as an Airdrop\) 

## Founders

We have set aside these tokens for the founders. These tokens will be locked and released:

* 25% after Year 1
* 25% after Year 2
* 25% after Year 3
* 25% after Year 4

## Partners and community initiatives

We would like to create partnerships with the following companies:

* [Copper](https://copper.co/)
* [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/)

We will also need funds to have our smart contracts audited.

## Community Treasury

The funds held in the community treasury will be controlled by a multisig and will be used to hire:

* Developers
* Designers
* Community managers
* Other positions as demand arises

## IFO

We will distribute the initial coins via an Initial Farm Offering. We were hoping that Pangolin would support this feature, but at the current rate, we may launch before this can occur.

We will implement the IFO using the Liquidity Pools of Pangolin for the AVAX-PNG Pair.

We value the token at $0.10 USD per RIP.

So anyone interested in purchasing RIP will be able to deposit their PGL tokens into our IFO contract. We will run the IFO for a month and at the end of the month, we will convert all of those locked token into two new Liquidity Pools. RIP-AVAX and RIP-PNG

Let's walk through an example:

* Over the course of a month $50,000 USD worth of AVAX and $50,000 USD worth of PNG is locked  up in PGL and then deposited in the IFO smart contract. 
* At the end of the month, the $50,000 USD of AVAX is deposited back into a new Pangolin pair with 500,000 RIP tokens
* The $50,000 USD of PNG is deposited back into a new Pangolin pair with 500,000 RIP tokens.

## Token demand

We will create demand via the following mechanisms:

* When someone creates a will, we lock up 1000 RIP until the death occurs. This removes those tokens, thereby increasing scarcity. This 1000 RIP is based on a $0.10 USD valuation. This rate can be changed based upon the price point of RIP to ensure it can adjust to the market.
* When someone makes a change, they get charged 10 RIP
* When a Will is distributed, the RIP comes back into circulation
* We will also offer Staking rewards similar to CREAM with the following rewards:
  * 38% APY
  * 65% APY
  * 109% APY
  * 134% APY
* Used in Governance voting
